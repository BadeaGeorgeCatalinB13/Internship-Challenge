STRENGTHS:
----------
✅ Semantic understanding through embeddings
✅ Multi-label classification supported
✅ Confidence scores for transparency
✅ Combines multiple data fields for better accuracy
✅ Efficient processing (~9494 companies in minutes)

LIMITATIONS:
------------
⚠️  7470 companies could not be classified (below threshold)
⚠️  Threshold selection impacts coverage vs precision
⚠️  New/niche insurance categories may not match well
⚠️  Requires manual validation for accuracy assessment

VALIDATION:
-----------
- Manual validation sample created: 50 companies
- File: 'manual_validation_sample.xlsx'
- Recommended: Complete manual labeling and calculate accuracy
- Expected accuracy: 70-85% based on similar tasks

SCALABILITY:
------------
Current processing time: ~2-5 minutes for 9494 companies
For 1 billion companies:
- Batch processing with GPU: ~1000 companies/second
- Estimated time: ~12 days single GPU, ~1 day with 10 GPUs
- Use FAISS for approximate nearest neighbor search
- Cache taxonomy embeddings (one-time computation)
